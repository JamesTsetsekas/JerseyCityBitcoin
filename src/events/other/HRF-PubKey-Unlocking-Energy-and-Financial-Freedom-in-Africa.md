The Human Rights Foundation and PubKey are teaming up to launch a new monthly series! Each month we'll dive into specific HRF initiatives with a focus on how #Bitcoin and #FreedomTech advance humanitarian goals.

Our inaugural event will be Thurs, Jan. 18th at 6pm with an exploration of Unlocking Energy and Financial Freedom in Africa w/ Christian Keroles Carla Kirk-Cohen & Thomas Pacchia

We're thrilled to partner with HRF to shine a light on how Bitcoin is a powerful force for peace and human flourishing. As always, these events are ~free & open to the public~

🧡🍻🙏
