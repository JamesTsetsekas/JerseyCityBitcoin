## Announcements
Please join us for our next Jersey City Bitcoin Metup at [Zeppelin Hall Beer Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xghGUsfjz4JeEvwp8) for beer and Bitcoin.


Althought this is not the first meetup as we have been having them monthly, this is the first time we are starting to keep count. Going foward we will be preparing loose agendas on new happenings or topics driven by suggestions from our community memmbers. Please Join our [telegram](https://t.me/+WOiR_ajP-AgxNmMx) to partipate in setting agendas for future meetups, and contributing content to our blog.
