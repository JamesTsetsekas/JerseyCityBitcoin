Running your own Bitcoin node is one of the most important steps you can take to verify your own transactions and contribute to the network's decentralization. 

We've prepared a comprehensive presentation covering everything you need to know about running your own node, from the basics to advanced configuration.

## Why Run Your Own Node?

Running your own Bitcoin node provides several key benefits:

- **Self-Verification**: Verify transactions independently without trusting third parties
- **Privacy**: Don't leak your transaction queries to external services
- **Network Health**: Contribute to Bitcoin's decentralization and resilience
- **Learning**: Gain hands-on experience with Bitcoin's core technology
