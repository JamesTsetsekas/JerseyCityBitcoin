Hello World! 

This Site will serve as an announcement board for Jersey City Bitcoin Meetup Events, and other local or larger meetups or bitdevs events. We also have a blog section, myself and some other members will be contributing to. If you are interested in contributing to the blog please contact us.

I think it's only fitting, being that this is the first "hello world" blog post of our site to include a quote Satoshi included in the genesis block.

"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

Looking forward to seeing you all at the next meetup
