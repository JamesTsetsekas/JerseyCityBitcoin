Hello World! 

This Site will serve as a announcment board for Jersey City Bitcoin Meetup Events, and other local or larger meetups or bitdevs events. We also have a blog section, myself and some other members will be contributing to. If you are interested in contributing to the blog please contact us via our [telegram](https://t.me/+WOiR_ajP-AgxNmMx).

I think its only fitting, being that this is the first "hello world" blog post of our site to include a quote satoshi included in the genesis block.

![Bitcoin Genesis block message](/images/blog/bitcoin-genesis-block.jpg "bitcoin-genesis-block-message")

"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" - Satoshi

Looking forward to seeing you all at the next meetup

\- Jersey City Bitcoin Meetup Team
