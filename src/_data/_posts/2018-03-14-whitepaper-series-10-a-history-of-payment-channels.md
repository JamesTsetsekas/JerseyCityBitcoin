title: "Whitepaper Series 10: A History of Payment Channels"

---

This is the first event in multi part series which will cover payment channels and the Lightning Network.

This event will focus on the history of payment channels. We will discuss the scaling issues Bitcoin is faced with, the early attempts to address those issues and the progression of upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol which ultimately enabled the advent of Duplex and Lightning Network payment channels. Once we have a solid foundational understanding we will look at two party bidirectional payment channel constructions in the Poon-Dryja and Decker-Wattenhofer channels. We will not be discussing their constructions in the multi-hop scenario, that will be reserved of a future event.

Please come prepared to discuss the following:
